LF Lens is a free app that describes as text whatâ€™s seen in a picture. You can take a picture from the camera or import from the device gallery. The picture and the description can be shared through Google Drive. You can save the pictures and the description to Google Drive for archival. 

The app has NO third-party trackers and shares no data with third-parties. It uses Microsoft Azure Cognitive services for identifying the objects in the pictures taken. LF Lens is built on Microsoft Xamarin Framework, and is made available as open-source at github.com/littlefeetlab.

LF Lens is happily made in India by Little Feet Services Pvt Ltd, Chennai.

We have developed this application using Visual Studio - Xamarin forms. Currently we are supporting for Andriod mobiles.
